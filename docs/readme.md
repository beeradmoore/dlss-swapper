## Why would you want to change the DLSS dlls in your game?

See [this](https://youtube.com/clip/UgzYyeox3s7jFJZAvYF4AaABCQ) clip, or better yet just watch the entire video ([Lego Builder's Journey Ray Tracing Showcase + DLSS 2.2 Upgrades Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtbqJXb1UDw)) from Digital Foundry. DLSS 2.2 discussions start at 11:40.

## Please note

This tool does **NOT** allow you to add DLSS to games that don't support it.

This tool does **NOT** guarantee that swapping DLSS dlls will:

- Improve DLSS performance.
- Reduce DLSS artifacts.
- Give a crash free experience.

In many cases you may fix some issues, in other cases you may prevent a game from launching (until you restore your original dll, provided in the tool).

Happy experimenting. As my university professor once said,

> The good thing about computer [science] is we will never die wondering 'What if...?'

Please, come and share your DLSS experience over in [r/DLSS_Swapper](https://www.reddit.com/r/DLSS_Swapper/).
